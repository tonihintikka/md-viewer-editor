# Epic-2: Mermaid Diagram Improvements

## Overview

This epic focuses on enhancing the Mermaid diagram support in our Markdown viewer application, with particular emphasis on international character support, error handling, and theme integration.

## Business Value

Proper Mermaid diagram support is crucial for technical documentation, especially for international users who need to create diagrams in their native languages. Improving this functionality will enhance user experience, reduce frustration, and expand the application's usability across different language groups.

## User Stories

1. [Story-3: Enhance Mermaid Diagram Support for International Characters](epic-2-story-3-mermaid-improvements.md)
2. Story-4: Implement Error Reporting and Debugging Tools for Mermaid Diagrams (Planned)
3. Story-5: Create Visual Documentation for Mermaid Best Practices (Planned)

## Success Criteria

- Users can create and view Mermaid diagrams with Finnish and other non-ASCII characters
- Diagrams render correctly in both light and dark themes
- Users receive helpful error messages when diagram syntax is incorrect
- Existing Markdown documents with Mermaid diagrams continue to work without modification

## Timeline

- Start: May 2025
- Target Completion: July 2025

## Dependencies

- Requires Mermaid.js library (version 10.0.2 or higher)
- Integration with application's theming system
- Markdown rendering pipeline modifications

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking existing diagrams | High | Medium | Extensive backward compatibility testing with existing content |
| Performance issues with complex diagrams | Medium | Low | Implement lazy loading and rendering optimization |
| Theme inconsistencies | Medium | Medium | Create theme-specific CSS and thorough testing in both modes |

## Technical Approach

We will implement a new `MermaidDiagram` React component that handles preprocessing of diagram definitions to accommodate special characters. This component will integrate with the application's theme context and provide multiple fallback mechanisms for diagram rendering.

The component will be designed to:
1. Automatically detect and fix common issues with international characters
2. Provide helpful error messages when rendering fails
3. Adapt to the application's current theme
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing content
