## Development Process

This project showcases a collaborative AI-assisted development process:

1. The initial single-file implementation was created with **Gemini 2.5 Pro** through a vibe coding session
2. Documentation and planning were developed collaboratively
3. The modern, modular implementation was created with **Augment Code** (powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet)

The development followed an iterative process where the original HTML file was provided as a starting point, followed by documentation creation, planning, and research on modern best practices before implementing the enhanced version.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two implementations of a Markdown viewer and editor:

### 1. Classic Implementation (Original)

The original implementation is a single-file HTML/JavaScript application that provides:
- Markdown rendering with proper formatting
- Built-in editor using CodeMirror
- File management through drag & drop
- Mermaid diagram support
- Local storage persistence

**Location:** Root directory (`index.html`)

### 2. Modern Implementation (2025)

A completely redesigned, modular implementation built with modern web technologies:
- React component-based architecture
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Light/dark theme support
- Responsive design for all devices
- Enhanced Markdown rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown
- Improved file management
- Modern UI with intuitive controls

**Location:** [`mdviewer-modern/`](mdviewer-modern/) directory ([View README](mdviewer-modern/README.md))

## Getting Started with the Modern Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Navigate to the modern implementation:
```bash
cd mdviewer-modern
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
